# AI Overview
Steam becoming invisible on Wayland can be a frustrating issue, but several potential solutions exist. One common fix involves disabling GPU accelerated rendering or hardware video decoding within Steam's interface settings. Another approach involves temporarily clearing Steam's cache or downgrading graphics drivers, though these solutions might not be permanent fixes. In some cases, launching Steam through the command line might offer a workaround. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown of potential solutions:

## 1. Disabling GPU Accelerated Rendering:
- Navigate to Settings: Open Steam and access the settings menu.
- Interface Settings: Look for the "Interface" or "Interface settings" section.
- Disabling Options: Locate and disable options like "Enable GPU accelerated rendering in web views" or "Enable hardware video decoding."
- Restart Steam: After making changes, restart Steam to see if the invisibility issue is resolved. 

## 2. Clearing Steam Cache:
- Access Download Menu: Within Steam, go to the "Downloads" menu.
- Clear Cache: Look for an option to clear the Steam cache.
- Restart Steam: After clearing the cache, restart Steam to see if the GUI reappears. 

## 3. Downgrading Graphics Drivers:
- Identify Your Drivers: Determine which graphics driver you are using (Nvidia, AMD, Intel).
- Downgrade: If applicable, downgrade your graphics drivers to an older version that is known to work with Wayland.
- Restart: Restart your system after downgrading the drivers. 

## 4. Launching Steam through the Command Line:
- Identify Steam's Location: Find the location of the Steam executable (e.g., /usr/bin/steam).
- Launch with Command: Open a terminal and use the command steam or the full path to the executable.
- Test for Visibility: Observe if Steam launches visibly when launched this way. 

## 5. Other Potential Issues:
**Wayland Session Compatibility:**
Ensure your Wayland session is properly configured and that Steam is compatible with it. 

**Steam Input and Cursor:**
If you're using the Steam Deck or other controllers, check if the cursor is becoming invisible due to Steam Input. 

**XDG Portal:**
In some cases, uninstalling certain XDG portal packages might help, according to a user on the Linux Mint forum.
